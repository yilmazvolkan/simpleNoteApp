# Simple Note Application
## Introduction
Simple Note Application is created to take notes and save them. A simple UI is designed for application to make it user-friendly and easy to use. Besides taking notes, you can attach an image URL with an extension such as jpeg, png, jpg etc. to view it on the screen. In this way, users might make connections between notes and images. You can delete a previous note or edit it. After editing, you will see a small "Edited" text under the note near created date. 

## Requirements
We determined some functional requirements for the project.

* Kotlin is preferred but not a must.
* Users must be able to create notes with input fields such as title, description, image url (input can be optional) and store it locally on their phones.
* Created note must contain a created date.
* There must be a way to display all saved notes in the list. An item on the list must contain the created date(dd/mm/yyyy), the image if url is available, title and max. 2 lines of description.
* There must be a way to edit/delete previously created notes. But edited notes must contain an (edited) tagsomewhere while being displayed on the list.
* All data should be persisted locally.
